## Post-decision Items

Deadline to complete for fall = June 1st
- Travel authorization, FCAF, consent to be registered, etc most important

## Travel Authorization

Emails for travel authorization (check from IRSO@utdallas.edu)

EXCM place holder\*

## Visa Items

Check w/ embassy to see what the requirements are. Our acceptance package will include things we need for our VISA. Every country will have at least 3 things you need with you for your VISA:
1. Acceptance letter from institution
2. Proof of funds (if receive FAFSA, submit award notification OR submit a copy of your bank statement)
3. Proof of insurance coverage

SKKU until June... 37:20 recording 4:18pm

- Check where to apply for VISA

Possibly can't apply for VISA 90 days before leave. It's a stamp on your passport that says you can enter this country. Some, you just need a resident's (residence?) permit. The school will send details on what we need, though. For example, they might need to provide specific documents for the process. 

Google: **Student visa for *country*** and pull up embassy site.

## Fees

$75 application fee (getting an email once we are charged)

Can use EZ-pay. 

Insurance fee is $30/week. Go onto the risk and safety tab and go to "Know your Insurance". Can be used to calculate how much insurance will be.

- Once travel authorization approved, we receive email saying it's been approved and IRSO has set you up with your insurance
- Don't need to sign up, will let you know when will be charged and show up on bursar like any other UTD bill/fee
- Will also get a link where we can request a proof of coverage letter
	- Fill out proof of coverage letter once approved and that's what we can use for our insurance visa application

## What to Pack

- Be aware of airline luggage limitations
- Pack only what you can't live without, then take out half
- Leave room for souvenirs
- Pack only what you can carry
- You can buy many items on-site
- One formal outfit, several casual
- Adapter/converter for electronics
- Bring items from your hometown/Texas/USA to give as host gifts

## Travel & Planning Tips

- Check COVID travel requirements to your country
	- Not just picture usually, need card in-person
- May have different definitions for "fully" vaccinated
	- Some may require booster, etc
- Add Verifly and Airline App to your phone

## Money Matters

Let your bank know that you will be traveling and to expect activity outside the normal area.

**Before you leave**:
- Notify bank + credit card company that you will be traveling abroad
- Get some cash in your destination currency to use upon arrival
- Find out if you will be able to use local ATMs
- Leave unnecessary cards at home
- Familiarize yourself with the exchange rate
- Consider giving power of attorney to a parent/close family member who can access your accounts in your absence

Make copies of your credit card front and back. When getting replacements, you need to give a lot of information to your bank. This makes it easier to report it has been lost or stolen (helps handle all disputes, basically).

**General money safety tips**:
- Carry only the cards & cash that you need
- Divide money between several pockets
- Carry a purse with a cross-body strap
- Keep your money on the front of your body
- Consider buying a money belt
- Use ATMs during the day

#### Foreign Transaction Fees

Check for "foreign transaction fees" if they're applicable. 

ATMs not part of banks will typically have this commission (non-bank *and* different currency - fees add up). Might want to take out larger amounts of money throughout the week to avoid paying the commission fees each time, but be smart each time you take it out an ATM. Don't do it at night, too alone, etc.

## Cultural Adjustment

**Culture Shock** - a clash between your views of the world and the new cultural environment

![[Pasted image 20220421171314.png]]

Tips to ease cultural adjustment:
- Do not expect to find the same things in the host country as you do in the USA
- Keep an open mind
- Do not judge a country by your encounters with one person
- Practice listening and observing, rather than hearing and seeing
- The host culture is different, not inferior
- Reflect on your experiences

Things to keep in mind:
- You are a guest
- You are an ambassador of the US and UT Dallas
- Act with humility

Be mindful of the message you are sending with your behavior
- What American behaviors might be seen as unfavorable in your host country?
- Negative stereotypes of Americans
	- How would those come about?
- Positive stereotypes

## Upon Arrival

- Let your family know you've arrived
- Update contact info in Comets Abroad Portal
- Use technology to keep in touch
	- WhatsApp
	- Skype
- Immerse yourself in the language and culture
	- Learn the map
	- Say yes!
